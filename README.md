Coursera_Systematic_Program_Design
==================================

The purpose of this repository is to house code developed by Jeremiah Tantongco.

The code contained here will be all from the 2013 course offering of Introduction to Systematic Program Design on Coursera.

The code will be primarily Dr. Racket (Scheme) but could include other class room artifacts.
